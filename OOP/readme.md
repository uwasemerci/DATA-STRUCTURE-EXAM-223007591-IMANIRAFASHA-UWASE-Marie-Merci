C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that provides a balance between performance, flexibility, and ease of use. It is widely used in systems programming, game development, software engineering, and competitive 
programming C++ Code Structure

#include <iostream>  // 1. Include necessary library

using namespace std;  // 2. Use standard namespace

int main() {  // 3. Main function where execution starts
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;  // 4. Output statement
    return 0;  // 5. Return statement indicating successful execution
}

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. #include <iostream> – Including Necessary Library
* The #include directive allows us to include standard libraries in our program.
* <iostream> (Input/output Stream) is necessary for performing input and output operations using cin (input) and cout (output).
* Without this, we wouldn't be able to print text or accept user input.
2. using namespace std; – Using Standard Namespace
* The Standard Library (std) contains commonly used functions like cout and cin.
* By writing using namespace std; we avoid writing std::cout and std::cin repeatedly.
* Although optional, it makes the code cleaner.
3. int main() – The Main Function
* Every C++ program must have a main() function.
* Execution starts from main().
* The function returns an integer (int), which is used by the operating system to check if the program ran successfully.
4. cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; – Output Statement
* cout (console output) is used to print text to the screen.
* << is an output operator.
* "Hello, World!" is the message to be displayed.
* endl; moves the cursor to the next line (alternative: \n).
5. return 0; – Indicating Successful Execution
* The return statement ends the main() function and sends a value back to the operating system.
* return 0; means the program executed successfully.
* If a program fails, it may return a nonzero value (like return 1; for an error).

Why Is This Structure Crucial?
* #include <iostream>: Without it, cout and cin wouldn't work.
* using namespace std;: Simplifies code readability.
* main() function: The entry point of execution.
* cout statement: Helps display information to the user.
* return 0;: Ensures the program signals successful execution.
 Notes on Data Types, Variables, and Operations in C++
1. Data Types
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. Common data types in C++ include:
Primitive Data Types
* int: Integer numbers (e.g., int age = 25;).
* float: Single-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., float pi = 3.14;).
* double: Double-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., double distance = 19.434;).
* char: Single character (e.g., char grade = 'A';).
* bool: Boolean values (true or false) (e.g., bool isActive = true;).
Derived Data Types
* array: Collection of elements of the same type.
* pointer: Stores memory address of another variable.
* reference: Alias for another variable.
User-Defined Data Types
* struct: Group of variables under one name.
* class: Blueprint for objects in OOP.
* Enum: Enumerated type for named integer constants.
2. Variables
Variables are containers for storing data. They must be declared with a data type and name.
Syntax
dataType variableName = value;
Example
int age = 30;
double salary = 45000.50;
char gender = 'M';
bool isEmployed = true;
Rules for Naming Variables
* Must start with a letter or underscore (_).
* Cannot contain spaces or special characters (except _).
* Cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., int, class).
      3. Operations
Operations are used to manipulate data.
Arithmetic Operations
* Addition (+): int sum = a + b;
* Subtraction (-): int diff = a - b;
* Multiplication (*): int product = a * b;
* Division (/): double quotient = a / b;
* Modulus (%): int remainder = a % b; (only for integers)
Assignment Operations
* Assign value: int x = 10;
* Compound assignment: x += 5; (equivalent to x = x + 5;)
Comparison Operations
* Equal to (==): if (a == b)
* Not equal to (!=): if (a != b)
* Greater than (>), Less than (<), etc.
Logical Operations
* AND (&&): if (a > 0 && b > 0)
* OR (||): if (a > 0 || b > 0)
* NOT (!): if (!isActive)
Increment/Decrement
* Increment (++): x++; (equivalent to x = x + 1;)
* Decrement (--): x--; (equivalent to x = x - 1;)
Example Code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Variable Declarations
    int a = 10, b = 5;
    float pi = 3.14;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool isPassed = true;

    // Arithmetic Operations
    int sum = a + b;
    float area = pi * a * a;

    // Output Results
    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Area: " << area << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Passed: " << isPassed << endl;

    return 0;
}
Key Points to Remember
1. Data Types define the kind of data a variable can store.
2. Variables must be declared with a data type and can store values.
3. Operations perform calculations, comparisons, and logical decisions.
4. Precision: Use float for single-precision and double for higher-precision calculations.
5. Type Safety: Ensure variables are used with compatible data types to avoid errors.
Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and error-free C++ programs!
